  "body": "# BacArena\r\n\r\nBacArena is an agent based modeling framework for cellular communities.\r\n\r\nExisting genome-scale metabolic models can be used to simulate growth and interactions in time and space.\r\nIn BacArena two well established methods are merged: a) Flux balance analysis to predict the activity of\r\nmetabolic reactions and b) Agent based modelling in order to provide an environment.\r\n\r\nIt has been  efficiently implemented in R language (with some C++ routines) and is freely available [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BacArena).\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Each organism is represented individually\r\n- Simulation of >10 different species and thousands of organisms on your desktop computer\r\n- Diffusion of substances\r\n- Screening of phenotypes\r\n- Detection of crossfeeding\r\n- Chemotaxis\r\n- Kinetics of reactions\r\n- Separation of simulation and evaluation\r\n- Rich evaluation methods (data mining)\r\n- Reproducible simulations\r\n- Object oriented implementation\r\n- Easily expandable due to rule based approach\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n- Install the latest release: \r\n  ```r\r\ninstall.packages(\"BacArena\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Install the development version:\r\n  ```r\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"euba/bacarena\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Special hints for linux user:\r\n  - glpk header files needed, e.g. for debian install package: libglpk-dev\r\n\r\n- Special hints for windows user:\r\n  - Besides [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) you need to install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Quick start\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(\"BacArena\")\r\nopenArena()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nA tutorial is available: [Introduction](https://github.com/euba/BacArena/raw/master/vignettes/BacArena-Introduction.pdf) \r\n\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n\r\nPlease report bugs, disorders or features you would like to see: [Issues](https://github.com/euba/BacArena/issues)\r\n",
