==Representation==
* Bacteria as agents in rule based modelling

==Microbial Ecology==
* Useing flux balance analysis for getting in and out fluxes which determine interaction between bacterial cell and its surrounding

==Growth==
* Biomass function -> cell division

==Thermodynamics==
* Feasability and direction of a reaction depends on concentration of metabolites

==Signalling==
* Quorum sensing
