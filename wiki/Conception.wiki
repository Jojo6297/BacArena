==Representation==
* Bacteria as agents in rule based modelling

==Microbial Ecology==
* Useing flux balance analysis for getting in and out fluxes which determine interaction between bacterial cell and its surrounding

==Movement==
* Random walk
* Permutation matrix

==Diffusion==
* Successive/simultane updating
* Random call

==Growth==
* Biomass function -> cell division
===Biomass function===
* [flux] = mmol/(g DW h) 
  (DW=dry weight)
* every flux is scaled to 1g dry weight -> if dry weight is higher -> greater flux
* non growth associated maintenance (ngam) -> essential need
* estimate ngam from stationary phase -> experimental data
* Biomass function as input -> calculate how long it is possible to survive with 1g dry weight
* percental withdrawal per turn

==Thermodynamics==
* Feasability and direction of a reaction depends on concentration of metabolites

==Signalling==
* Quorum sensing
