=Additional Thoughts=

==E.coli and lower/upper bounds==
* Does it make sense to include different lowerbounds of glucose uptake according to oxygen concentrations?
* Anaerobic lifestyle is more interesting -> social interactions
* Different uptake rates are only included to match biological experiments -> no rational explanations for the values 

==Metabolic competion between species==
* What happens if two species compete for the same substrate?
* In the current model the individual, which is actualized first gets all -> bias towards the first listed in bac dataframe
* Different ranking in bac list -> "strong" species are listed first, which are known from empirical values to outcompete others?

==Different substrate diffusion function==
* Take idea of Christoph
* Actualize the whole substrate grid instead just the neighbourhood
* Different diffusion rates for each specific substrate

==Life and Death==
* Current ecoli core model does not include full biomass requirements (amino acid, vitamin, ... metabolism)
* Living costs should be implemented in growth maintenance
* When cells are dividing separate whole metabolome (all molecules) of the individual between doughter and mother cell
* What is the real treshold for death?

==Syntrophic E.coli==
* Create new SBML model (ecoli_mut.R), where glucose uptake is knocked out
* Main substrate for ecoli.R is glucose and for ecoli_mut.R acetate

==Chemotaxis==
* What is faster diffusion or movement?
* If diffusion is faster no spatial patterns (aggregation) of species interactions can be seen
* Chemotaxis in neighbourhood or actualization of whole grid?
* Define to which substrate bacteria should diffuse to -> problematic: mutiple substrates
* Chemotaxis: tumbling and active swiming
