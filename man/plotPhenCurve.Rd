\title{Plot growth curve for several simulations}
\usage{
plotPhenCurve(simlist, subs, phens = NULL, time = c(NULL, NULL),
  ret_phengroups = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{simlist}{A list of simulations (eval objects).}

\item{subs}{A vector of substance names that are used for phenotype clustering.}

\item{phens}{If phencurve is given then phens specifies the phenotypes which sould be plotted again.}

\item{time}{Vector with two entries defining start and end time}
}
\description{
The function \code{plotPhenCurve} takes a list of simulations and plots the time course of species with standard deviation.
